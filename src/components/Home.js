            <p>
              Our amazing Open Source journey started in early 2000s. And what a
              ride it has been. We did not imagine that we would have such
              widespread adoption and deployment of Open Source technologies
              over the years. We are happy to have been able to play a bit of
              role in that adoption by being a fellow traveller with our
              associates, customers and partners alike

            <p>Our Story</p>

            <p>
              Keen and Able started as a college dream in the mind of a few
              youngsters who just wished to have something to call their own.
              Open Source happened by chance. But has stuck for long. Over the
              years, we have dabbled in many associated Open Source technologies
              and successfully helped our customers adopt them.
            </p>
     
            <p>
              We believe our strength lies in taking challenges head on and be
              of help to our customers in all areas of software deployment -
              architecture and planning, deployment and support.
            </p>

            <p>
              Being a services focused organisation, we are able to think beyond
              product and strive to provide our customers with solutions that
              help them address their business need rather than deploy a
              product.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have been quite fortunate to have been able to work both in
              community and enterprise Open Source solution deployments. We have
              been living our dream of creating people who are deft in
              fulfilling customer needs through Open Source means.

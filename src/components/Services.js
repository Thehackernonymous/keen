                Over the years, we have come across many situations where a
                design mistake has already been made when we are called. It is a
                very tough situation for a customer and we can totally empathise
                with it. Should the customer go ahead knowing that there is an
                issue due to cost, time and other considerations; or should
                start afresh. There is no easy answer here. But what we have
                realised is that the software design and architecture should be
                open and have a building blocks approach to make it last. Our
                areas of interest here are
